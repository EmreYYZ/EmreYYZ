### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Emre, a product designer, hobbyist coder and a digital archivist.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
  - `XMRDCA`: which is a tool that helps people to invest in Monero by using the Dollar Cost Averaging method.
  - `Mac Dee`: which is a cryptocurrency trading bot.
  - I plan to go full-time digital nomad. It is a challenging process so I'm working on it.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
  - `React`: I guess it is a must to learn this.

- I want to learn
  - `Python`: I need to learn it for my pleasure. I want to work on machine learning and data more, so it makes sense for me to learn it.
  - `Rust` or `Go`: Always wanted to learn a lower level programming language to be able to make lightweight software. So language-wise, this seems to be my current horizon. `C` might be too extreme for me, but that is also one of the options. I see this as a challenge more than a "lemme learn that to find a job or actually do something".
