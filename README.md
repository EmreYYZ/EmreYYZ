### Hi there 👋
I'm Emre, a product designer, hobbyist coder and a digital archivist. Originally from Turkey, I currently reside in Toronto, Canada. 

🔭 **Currently working on ...**
  - A secret personal `React` project that includes web-scraping, `Firestore` and some backend development.
  - `😺 monero.cat`: a tool that helps people to invest in `Monero` by using the `Dollar Cost Averaging` method.
  - `🙎🏻‍ Mac`: a cryptocurrency trading bot.
  - I plan to go full-time digital nomad. It is a challenging process so I'm working on it. (Also planning to work on a planner tool for it.)

🌱 **Currently learning ...**
  - `⚛️ React`: I guess it is a must to learn this.

📚 **want to learn ...**
  - `🐍 Python`: I need to learn it for my pleasure. I want to work on machine learning and data more, so it makes sense for me to learn it.
  - `Rust` or `Go`: Always wanted to learn a lower level programming language to be able to make lightweight software. So language-wise, this seems to be my current horizon. `C` might be too extreme for me, but that is also one of the options. I see this as a fun challenge, as a hobby.
